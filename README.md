- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EmmaTrann
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a software engineering student. I'm interested in cyber security and machine learning. This GitHub account I used to document my university course works. I am currently working as a co-op Software Engineer at @Kinaxis and unfortunately no code can be shared outside. I will update more personal project once I'm back to school again. 
- ðŸ“« You can reach out to me via Linkedin
